# Sound Files for Learn-to-Talk App

This directory should contain the following sound files for the "On-the-Fly" feature:

1. `success.mp3` - A short, positive sound that plays when pronunciation matches
2. `try_again.mp3` - A gentle, encouraging sound that plays when pronunciation needs improvement

## Recommended Sound Types

- **Success Sound**: A short, cheerful chime or bell sound (0.5-1 second)
- **Try Again Sound**: A gentle "whoosh" or soft tone (0.5-1 second)

## How to Add Sound Files

1. Download or create appropriate MP3 sound files
2. Rename them to `success.mp3` and `try_again.mp3`
3. Place them in this directory
4. Run `flutter pub get` to update asset references

Note: Keep sound files small (under 100KB each) to maintain app performance.
